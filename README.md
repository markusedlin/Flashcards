# Flashcards
This flashcard program is something I made so that I could study german words, while living in Germany. I decided to overcomplicate it
and make a version myself, instead of using an online program for it. 
I have two versions of the program, one in python (which is much easier to handle files in, but not great at a simple GUI), and one in JS, which is much more different
with handling files, but allows for a simple interface using HTML. 

To start in html:
Open the flashcard.html file.
Upload the file of the list of words containing the word and translation per line.
Press the Flash button to start the flashcards.
Make your guess and press enter or submit. Then should pop up the result as a link to a website containing more information about the word, including the article of nouns.
    This does sometimes not work, as it may think an adjective is a noun, thus resulting in the incorrect website link.
    

To start in python:
Run the main.py
the german word pops up, write what you think the translation would be and hit ENTER.
It will ask if you are actually correct, with an override function, otherwise just press ENTER again to go to the next word.
Continue until list is completed.


The plan with these was to add a statistic to each word, keeping track of progress. Then the idea was to further build some sort of analysis program, but I will leave
that to another date.
